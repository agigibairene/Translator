## Project Overview
The **Kinyarwanda-English Translation App** is designed to simplify translation tasks for individuals who do not understand Kinyarwanda. It offers two main features:

1. **Kinyarwanda Text to English Text Translation**: Provides accurate and contextually relevant translations.

2. **English Speech to Text Conversion with Kinyarwanda Translation**: Converts English speech into text, which can be translated into Kinyarwanda. This is ideal for users needing real-time translations for conversations or professional engagements.

The app uses React with Vite for fast development and Hot Module Replacement (HMR), ensuring a smooth user experience and rapid iterations.

## Features
- **Kinyarwanda to English Translation**: Quick and precise translations.
- **Speech-to-Text Conversion**: Converts English speech into text efficiently.
- **Speech-Driven Translation**: Instant translation from spoken English to Kinyarwanda.
- **React with Vite Integration**: Minimal setup with efficient HMR for development.
- **User-Friendly UI**: Simple, clean, and intuitive design.

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: React.js, Vite, Tailwind CSS
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js
- **Machine Learning Models**: TensorFlow, PyTorch
- **Speech Recognition**: Google Cloud Speech-to-Text API
- **Translation Models**: Custom NLP models trained on Kinyarwanda-English datasets
- **Development Tools**:
  - ```@vitejs/plugin-react``` for Babel-based Fast Refresh
  - ```@vitejs/plugin-react-swc``` for SWC-based Fast Refresh
- **Deployment**: Vercel

# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
